## 📌 Overview  
This project dives into the **Skyline Real Estate** domain with the goal of building a **highly accurate house price predictor**.  
We analyze **multiple property, neighborhood, and market factors** to help buyers and sellers make informed decisions.  

💡 Our approach goes **beyond just square footage and location**, covering multiple variables to get a realistic price estimate.

## 📊 Features Considered  

| Category | Features |
|----------|----------|
| 🏘 **Neighborhood** | Distance to public transportation, school proximity, crime rates, nearby amenities |
| 🏡 **Property** | Age, renovations, lot size, architectural style, bedrooms, square footage |
| 📈 **Market Trends** | Recent sales data, average income, mortgage rates, economic indicators |

---

## 🎯 Project Objective  
By combining **machine learning algorithms** with **rich datasets**, we aim to:  
- Help **buyers** choose the right property at a fair price  
- Enable **sellers** to price their property competitively  
- Offer **insights** into the factors that drive property values
